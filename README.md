# SwiftlyDLX

Swiftly DLX is an attempt at providing a simple but efficient Algorithm X method. If you are not familiar with Knuth's Dancing links algorithm I suggest you read his paper https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jchu/publicportal/sudoku/0011047.pdf

Because of the memory management of swift I am not using a true implementation of swift but a variation which I have found works more efficiently in Swift. I hope to be able to find a way to implement this algorithm true to Knuth's idea. Knuth even mentions in his paper memory management might be an isssue with this method.

This is just for fun. Use at your own risk.
